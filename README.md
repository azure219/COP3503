# COP3503
Projects and Labs from Programming 2

An archive of my different projects and labs from Programming 2 (COP3503C) in C++. 
For the majority of the folders the only files of significance are the .cpp and .h files and the input files if any.
In the Minesweeper folder the game files are: main.cpp, T.h, GW.h, welcomeWindow.h, and welcomeWindow.cpp.
